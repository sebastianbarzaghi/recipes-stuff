        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Hummus, also spelled hommus or houmous, is a Middle Eastern dip, spread, or savory dish made from cooked, mashed chickpeas blended with tahini, lemon juice, and garlic. The standard garnish in the Middle East includes olive oil, a few whole chickpeas, parsley, and paprika.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To prepare hummus, first drain and rinse the precooked chickpeas, then transfer them to a mixer. Pour in lemon juice, tahini and oil.</li>
            <li>Also add salt and, if you wish, a clove of crushed garlic and deprived of the core. Operate the mixer and blend by adjusting the speed and duration according to the desired result, which can be smoother or more rustic. Add 2-3 tablespoons of water as needed to reach the desired consistency: instead of water you can use a little more lemon juice, to accentuate the acidic note, or oil or tahini, for a richer flavor. We opted for a cream with a buttery and light texture.</li>
            <li>Transfer the hummus to a bowl and garnish with paprika, pepper, a drizzle of oil and chopped parsley to taste. Your hummus is ready to be enjoyed!</li>
        </ol>
